			<p class="session-tales">
			&emsp;<span class="character">Wavebreaker</span> dives back in to the water and is given the riddle at the end of the cave. After returning to his friends and consulting with them, he realizes he might have the answer. <span class="character">Wavebreaker</span> returns before the Dragon door, to speak the name Silence and door opened. He took the items.<br><br>&emsp;
			They left the cavern and emerged into the forest. Happened upon a bridge with roads leading East and West. To the East they saw plumes of black smoke  and decided to investigate.<br><br>&emsp;
			<span class="character">Eldathine</span> was visited my Eldath: The Savage God Malar has found a new master. The High Hunt is coming.<br><br>&emsp;
			Arriving at the caravan, they discover a scene of the macabre. Bodies of men thrown on a pyre, burning their flesh from bone. The smell of burning flesh was wafting through the air. Approaching the caravan,  they realize that these men were burned alive, without being stripped of anything.<br><br>&emsp;
			It is then that they hear the call for help. Coming around the cart they happen upon a man, with only one working arm attempting to defend himself from a pack of wolves circling him, closing in for the kill.<br><br>&emsp;
			They take their surprise attack to attempt to slay the foul beasts, but in the end, it is Woeber's [[speak with animals]] that causes the beasts to depart.<br><br>&emsp;
			This saved <span class="character">Owic</span>, if only momentarily, and he let them know all that they needed to know. Hely was taken, along with <span class="character">Malia</span>, who is going to be sold into slavery. The group is at a crossroads on going to Luskan because <span class="character">Wex</span> is hesitant about returning to his former city which he is banished from.<br><br>&emsp;
			Wex threw the drow poison darts into <span class="character">JimJars</span> neck and put him out. That in turn caused <span class="character">Ront</span> to rage. They killed <span class="character">Ront</span>, and framed <span class="character">JimJar</span> for his murder.<br>&emsp;
			<span class="character">Eldathine</span> used Zone of Truth on <span class="character">Wex</span>, and caused him to admit to his background in Luskan.<br><br>&emsp;
			Finished the session with the decision that the return to Luskan to save <span class="character">Hely</span> is a must.

			<h2 id="session2">Entering the City of Luskan</h2>
			<p class="session-tales">
			<span class="character">Eldathine attempted to diplomatically approach <span class="character">Marek the Shank Blackfeather</span> and gain access to Luskan through purchasing their way in. The Bloodrun Reavers, pushing <span class="character">Eldathine's</span> patience, caused him to unleash Radiance of the Dawn, causing combat to ensue.<br><br>&emsp;

			The Reavers made reference to <span class="character">Pack Father Borev</span>, before being slain at the city gates. This opened the flood gates to allow the peasants and riff raff outside to storm the city and flood in through the city gates.<br><br>&emsp;

			Upon entering Luskan, <span class="character">Wex</span> decides to lead the party to his father's old shop, Pop's Shop of Wood Goods. Upon arriving, they enter an establishment covered in cobwebs being maintained by an old woman named <span class="character">Tonga</span>. <span class="character">Tonga</span> explains that <span class="character">"Master Wain"</span> was taken by <span class="character">Pack Father Borev</span> to his manor on the Isle to the Northwest of the city. Wex explores his father's quarters to discover stains of dried blood and some claw gouges out of the woodwork. <span class="character">Eldathine</span>, suspecting the old woman of foul play, uses Thaumaturgy to intimidate her, causing her to have a subsequent heart attack and collapse.
